### Description  
This project is a React-based web application that demonstrates the concept of lossless audio compression using Huffman Coding. It allows users to upload an audio file, analyzes the frequency of audio data, generates the Huffman tree, and visualizes the encoding process step-by-step.

The main objective of the project is to provide a clear visual understanding of how Huffman Coding works in real-time, specifically in the context of compressing audio data.

### Key Features  
- Accepts custom text input for compression  
- Analyzes character frequency distribution  
- Dynamically constructs Huffman Tree  
- Step-by-step visualization of encoding process  
- Displays compression statistics (original vs compressed)  
- Visualizes real-time decoding using the Huffman Tree

### Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Visualization:** p5.js / custom canvas rendering  
- **Audio Handling:** JavaScript Web Audio API
